Project 609: Model-based Reinforcement Learning
Description:
Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) involves learning a model of the environment's dynamics (i.e., how the state evolves when actions are taken). Instead of relying solely on trial and error, the agent can plan ahead by using this learned model to predict future states and rewards. In this project, we will implement MBRL by learning a dynamics model of the environment and using it to plan actions.
